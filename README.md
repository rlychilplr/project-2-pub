The requirements of the website can be found [here](documentatie/eisen.md) in dutch
since this website is directly related to my current school it uses some by the school copyrighted materials (eg. logo).
it also uses some copyrighted material from some social media websites (eg. x (formerly twitter), instagram, facebook and more), i have put the source of these logo's in the code at the place they are implemented

### if you use/copy something from the repo please make sure you are carefull with the copyrighted materials
